# Neuron models

There has been a rapid development in the computational neuroscience towards modeling neurons and neural network. These neuron model focuses on the dynamics of the neural systems rather than on the exact morphology of individual neurons.

In this book, we discuss a few neuron models, their dynamics in terms of differentuial equation and their implementation via `Brian2` python toolbox.	 

Popular models include

1. Generic conductance-based model 
2. Hodgkinâ€“Huxley or conductance-based model (specific)
3. Leaky-integrate and fire model
4. Izhikevich model
